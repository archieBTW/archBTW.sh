[why is it spicy?]
It was 5 or 4pm when they held the ceremony.
Gave him a third-rate secondhand 1st place trophy.

Blastoff. The shockwaves destroyed all the windows.
Crescent moon, starry eyed. Silent crescendo.

No strings attached so all the puppets ran free. 
The forest feels familiar. The valley's uncanny. 

Skyline's highlighted. In hindsight, I'd underline it.
Apple in the limelight. Bronze-covered silver linings. 

My gums are bleeding but the cottonmouth should soak it up. 
Jogging with a rabbit foot but running out of luck.

Clearance sale saturday. Monday, we're retro.
He'll take all the hand-me-downs you outgrow. 

Majored in madness, minored in morose.
The rose does smell sweeter when you call it a rose.

Backgammon with receptors . Backhanded undermine. 
Filleted the atom with a butter knife.

It wasn't rocket science. It was barely AP. 
He had vivid visions but he made straight-Ds. 

In high-speed pursuit of any good mood.
Made of rubber that's drenched in glue. 





[i'll have the ribs please]
He made me out of dust pulled from the ground
It was eerily quiet. The birds were the only sound. 

Life was pretty lonely in this garden. 
With pure gold. Onyx for carving.

He tried to entertain me. I got to name the beasts
but I kept finding myself looking west from the east. 

He had a bone to pick with me. 
Maybe it's an idiom but he did it surgically.

Sewn. Do the stitches make me look cool?
I didn't need that bone. The only thing missing here was you. 

Becoming one flesh. Now I want a piece of your mind. 
There's plenty of things to do here but I don't want to just pass the time. 

Naked but not ashamed. It's just us and the weather's nice. 
I love the way your fingers trace my chest and its lopside. 

This seems too good to be true but no one here knows how to lie. 
I don't want this day to end. Let's stay up and talk all night. 

I could stay awake for days here in this scene.
And when I crash, I still see you in my dreams. 

Maybe this is all just some metaphor
but I really think it's real and it's spectacular. 

Sewn. Do the stitches make me look cool?
I didn't need that bone. The only thing missing here was you. 

Becoming one flesh. Now I want a piece of your mind.

[smoke signals]
It's barely 2 in the morning. 
Bright eyed and bushy tailed
Warning, it's habit-forming
Goodbye baseline. Exhale.

The smoke spoke French
Which I don't quite understand.
I can detect the tone though, 
Which was rather bland.

Spice it up. Ecto. 
Let the ghost peppers haunt.
Reaper closing in. 
We were doomed from the start. 

In the nooks and crannies,
there's a couple empty carts.
They were supposed to make it
easier but it's just as hard.

Soldered on. Weak connections. 
I burnt myself by mistake. 
Just peruse my intentions.
There's a lot at stake. 

Pixie dust, angel wings,
and the horns of a demon. 
The were quick to condemn
but never asked for the reason.

Not that he knew the answer anyway.
Though he might.
He felt around for his brain. Gave up 
and turned on the light.

Granite. Marble counters.
I'm the dirt in the grout. 
You can try to mop me up.
Just let the chemicals air out. 

He wrote it down before 
it popped into his head.
Impulsively jumped in
Instead of planning ahead.

Parasitic plants
destroy ecosystems.
He'd cry out for help
if anyone would listen. 


[f5]
Fabricated stories of submission and losses. 
White flag is up. Side effects without causes. 

Made of half a battery. Salt over the shoulder.
Selfishly dropped it while facing the shareholders. 

Lithiated lemon lime. It's great for your nausea. 
With tremoring hands, he counted the comets.

Burning the forest, praying for some rain.
Every stoplight, he's stopped by a train. 

It gets better. That's what they tell me at least.
Honor system is gone, grabbing handfuls of treats. 

You're running fast but you'll never finish first.
You're an NPC on a makeshift earth.

I can't seem to sleep much these days.
Buried alive in a 4k display. 

HD night terrors. Hijacked the flight.
He counted to ten and closed both of his eyes. 

Deep breaths. The sun will be up soon.
The birds will announce it with songs that swoon.

Outgoing calls that are never received. 
Stuck in an F5. He's just more debris.



[we just need to budget better]
Out on the balcony, sharing our last smoke 
We tried to save it for the AM but we both started to jones

We napped all day. There's nothing else to do.
Can we get 3 dollars on pump number 2?

Noodles again. I think we're both sick of it.
The tap water's not bad here. Well, maybe just a bit. 

The lights didn't come on when we hit the switch. 
But i heard its better to be poor than to be rich.

We don't need to worry about food or what to wear.
He feeds and clothes the birds and probably the bears. 

Money equals camels passing through the needle's eye.
There's gonna be a big party when we finally arrive. 

We'll get to see our grandparents and the terriers we miss. 
So we don't need to fear, or dread, or even be anxious. 

Yeah, it'd be nice to have variety. Even just a big Mac. 
But we can get a free junior burger if we sign up on this app.

We'll cut it in half and have a couple bites each. 
Maybe there's enough in the couch for a small sweet tea. 

I promise God will make it better. Layoffs or not.
You can't buy this kind of happiness. If you could, it'd cost a lot. 

We don't need to worry about food or what to wear.

[is that real wool?]
There's a bump on the log in the hole of your eye. 
Get comfy. The abyss has no night light.

Sea floor. Watch the angler fish escape.
They tried to show you how. Even saw them demonstrate.

Come out and see the Son. It's worth a little death. 
Just swim up. Though, your puddle has no depth.

Whitewashed tombs full of bones and dust and fingernails.
High and mighty you might be but I'll keep singing the sinner's prayer.

Why pretend that we're something that we're not?
We sat in your pew, forgot the answers that you sought.

You heard but didn't comprehend. Whatever did he say?
One ear to the other even if it gets replayed.

At least we know that we're confused and lost and dropped all the directions. 
The subscription GPS in your SUV's defective.

"Forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors."
All she had was 2 cents and she still tipped better.

You can raise your hands and recite any words thrown on the screen. 
But as you think in your heart, so you do. Don't be deceived.

Either give up or give and do your best to take away.
There's lessons in the parchment, open up to any page.






[i don't like you very much]
I want to shove you in the refrigerator and duct tape it shut. 
Then take a long vacation and check back in a month 

I'll go wherever you dream of going and send you a post card.
I don't wish you were here. XOXO heart. 

I wanna learn a hundred languages just to have more curse words
To throw your way. I won't resort to slurs.

Break off all your pencil lead before filling up your pencil box.
Take the blade from the sharpener and hide it in your socks. 

I wanna buy you groceries and then let them expire.
Donate them to your favorite cause before setting them on fire. 

Let's play Doctor but let's not play pretend. 
I don't have any experience but I'll carve out your pretense

Sugar in your gas tank just sounds so kindergarten.
I'll use a flaming rag right before it's started.

Put handwarmers in your pillows and then move in next door. 
Blaring genres that you hate and then I'll laugh and laugh some more.

I'm scared of spiders but you are too so I'll tough it out
And build up a collection I'll pour in your sleeping mouth

What's your favorite movie? I'll rewrite the story
And then go back in time and make sure they make it boring. 

I think you see where I'm going but you seem dumb so maybe not. 
Next time you'll think twice before taking my parking spot.



[where's the boat?]
It's 4:30am. I've already been up for hours. 
Contemplating life and death and my own lack of power. 

Was that just a weird dream or a vision from an angel?
Will the journey go smoothly or will it continue to be painful?

Where are we headed? Do You want me overseas? 
I'll go door to door if needed. Just guide me please. 

I've never been so confused. Everything is a sign.
But there's a lot of contradictions. It's hard to discern what's Yours and mine. 

What is my purpose? Just to spin around on a rock?
I know You've got a plan. We're waiting for a boat at the dock.

How long will You make us wait? This is getting harder by the second.
I know that I'm impatient but I also know that You're omnipotent. 

Where am I needed? I hate these idle hands.
What is my calling? What are Your demands? 

We read Your book everyday while we pray and cry and plead.
I hate to see her sad. I can't fix it. What do You want from me? 

I'll shave my head. Starve myself. Whatever it takes. 
Just to know You heard my voice. Lord, I'm about to break. 

I know You'll get us out of this rut. I can't wait to see how. 
Emphasis on "can't wait". We're going crazy. Can it happen now?

What is my purpose? Just to spin around on a rock?
I know You've got a plan. We're waiting for a boat at the dock.

How long will You make us wait? This is getting harder by the second.

[bad luck comes in threes]
Pass the brush, I'm repainting all these faded memories
They're there. Their tears are all over the tainted tapestry

Triple scoop split stains and grape juice spills clotting on the carpet
Two-thirds the time I'm manic and the other third's lethargic 

Narcotics on the nightstand near a bottle of psychosis 
Still can't keep a schedule to save me from neurosis 

Chasing carrots like the ass that I am, nearly caught a couple. 
The powder from the drywall is just glitter for my bloody knuckles 

The car might be a rental. I don't care. I'll light a cigarette.
3 pictures on the dash but with no faces though, just silhouettes.

Now my angles rearranged, I'm at the center of isosceles
Flashbacks and hand grenades, fragments of what was once reality.

I close my eyes, they take the pen and write me love notes for the future me.
I read them everyday, sometimes I think that there's a mutiny

I know that they mean well just like me, despite the spiteful wishes.
They said I get 3 so I display them near my china dishes.

I always called them demons but now I call them all my friends.
There's demons all around, they're not the voice in my head.

I just personify my misery, embalmed in red ink.
Pushed through the paper, wounded heart carved 6 deep.


[so it's a whole...thing]
It took her three words made of 2-cubed characters 
I added a 3 letter string and just stared at her
Froze where I stood and threw both of my hands up
Her magnet's a criminal, yet I'm in the handcuffs

I glare from her bed at the sheer that she wears
I evolve into metapod but her card's rare
She's got secrets to keep, shoulder surfing the combo
Got a few too that I'll blurt on her talkshow 

I'm a dream come true if your dream is a nightmare
I wish it wasnt true, I can't lie though, I'm self-aware
The medication makes me think that I'm alright now
I really want to make it happen but I don't know how

She catches my throws, all her moves are contagious
Her eyes are the one thing more red than her face is
Let me enter your mind in a spaceship
Oh my God, what is this drug love is laced with 

Threw everything in the well 'cause I'm hopeful
When I am not holding your hand, I go postal
Sometimes we laugh at the lines where I'm boastful
But you are the toast if the world is a toaster

I'm a dream come true if your dream is a nightmare
I wish it wasnt true, I can't lie though, I'm self-aware
The medication makes me think that I'm alright now
I really want to make it happen but I don't know how

"Its time for your daily check-in.
Depression?" 7/10

"Do you have thoughts of harming others?"
No. "Yourself?", I can't be bothered

"How about about anxiety?" It's fucking great.
"Please leave out the expletives and rate it" Ok, 8. 

"Ok that's all we need. So here's another chemical."
What is the efficacy? Because I've never been so cynlical.

"Just take the pill and go to group. Your next smoke breaks at 5. 
You can have up to 2 cigarettes. Just make sure you're in line"

"Ok, gather around. We're gonna do a mandala."
What's this have to do with getting rid of anhedonia?

"Don't ask questions. Just grab yourself a marker. 
We don't trust you with a pen." That's okay, I'll just push harder. 

"Is that another threat? Because we'll mark you as a fall risk'
No. I drew you a stick figure. "Oh my Gosh, you're such an artist"

Another victimized starts screaming, I "ripped off" ttheir material. 
But we're getting close to smoking. Once we're done with cafeteria. 

The foods actually not  that bad. Better than school lunch. 
Until another asshole like myself just upped and blew up

I get it though I'm restless too. Jitters at the trough. 
But 26 more minutes and I'll get my Camel Crush.

[but then I had lunch and felt mostly ok]
Perpetual mania, blue-balled brain
Interrupt with a smile faintly feign 

I quit the gambling on a bet
Still chasing dragons with a butterfly net 

Stay woke, the sheep broke their legs
And try not to step on the spider eggs

Shells are scattered and you're barefoot
Life and death are defined by output

Why do we act opaque when we're so transparent?
Her cherry red lips taste like blueberry mint. 

I couldn't put a single digit on it at the time
But honestly, I'd never seen an alligator cry

Scarred concrete from the cherry of a camel
Grinning with nicotine teeth that lack enamel

Tried to sneak by with tic-tacs in my pocket
The double-feature wasn't worth the socket

My fabled story sank faster than the ship did
Water up to our knees as soon as I said the second sentence 

I just keep passing the blame like offering plates
Knowing damn well I'm at fault for quakes

Why do we act opaque when we're so transparent?
Her cherry red lips taste like blueberry mint. 

I couldn't put a single digit on it at the time
But honestly, I'd never seen an alligator cry

Assumptions, assumptions. Both sides see the switch
Mouth's in a marathon, ribbon's stitched 

Scalpels dissecting your arctic scapula,
clavicle, and humerus. She thinks I laughed at her.

Anger like matches, flickers and phases
The French have a word for you matching my crazy

Jericho to my barriers, force fields to fumes
I'm all out of metaphors to capture the mood

Why do we act opaque when we're so transparent?
Her cherry red lips taste like blueberry mint. 

I couldn't put a single digit on it at the time
But honestly, I'd never seen an alligator cry


[parseltongue]
Hissing, I slither through branches and leaves
Kissed you and carved our names into the tree

The words rolled off of the tongue like a somersault
Into your bedroom and into your horoscope

Counting the stars and then wishing on catapults
Off of my axis, your eyes are like telescopes

You see through the negative, see through the lies
I'm just a fuckboy and you're my demise

Those eyes and thighs are calling like creditors
Some line like that just to crawl into bed with her

Coiled like serpents inside of our den
Wrapped up together and shedding our sin

Stick out your tongue and sniff out your surroundings
He lurks in the dark with his heartbeat just pounding

The sound of the creaking of floorboards below
Beneath all the scales though, he's not such a foe

So hold tight, be patient, he'll reap what he harvested
Instead entice him with all of your artistry

Forget what I said please, it's not how I meant it
He's crazy in love, now he's two times committed

[who you calling a ho, ho?]
A lit Christmas. A wishlist of wishes.
Toe of mistle, underneath which I kiss lips
And grab hips, shotgun hits. The clause says missus.
The tree is in the swisher with spit to stick it.

Cinnamon toothpicks but never chews pepper.
Bloodshot green eyes and wreaths with scarlet letters.
A couple vintage schmucks in brand new ugly sweaters.
Beggars can't be choosers, but choosers can be beggars.


I saw the sleigh crash as Elon fled the scene
With a passenger with fool's gold hair that recedes.
Replayed 4:3 domestics on imported widescreens.
Drove away in their Tesla sipping juiced cocoa beans.

Bloody snow melted off Santa's faux white collar.
Now there's 8 or 9 deer on a beatup hauler.
But as the wreckage gets cleared, the problems get smaller.
What'll he do next? He's no scholar.


12th month, filing the 13th chapter
While the stocks keep soaring on the deceased raptors.
In the rafters, stored for our afters. 
I only self-destruct because I want to get there faster

Can't leave the house if the gears don't shift. 
Santa Claus is down and we need a pinch-hit.
Jaws dropped when Bezos whipped out his dick.
10 bucks a month, 2 days free, and it's shipped.

How many dollars do you love me?
Money is a drug and I know you want to drug me. 
Mickey in the eggnog and now he feels funny
This time of year is just so lovely.

I'm so glad it's Christmas







 [oh Christmas tree]
Early morning, the sun peeks through the blinds.
Eyes red and green, colored outside the lines.

Oh Christmas tree, we laugh while we roll.
In its place, we put up a pole.

The vapors rise and we follow suit.
When the paper runs out, we can barter with fruit.  

Icy cold hands but you radiate warmth. 
Under the covers and over this world. 


Prancing below us are reindeer that fly. 
It might be in our heads but it's such a gorgeous sight.

He can skip our house. We'll eat the cookies instead. 
We've got everything we need right here in bed.


Twelve-gauged pecks from my favorite pigeon.
They shouldn't have left us without supervision.

We threw the first stone but we aimed at ourselves.
Can you load up the next one? You do it so well.

Stockings flanking our digital fire.
I don't want to go to sleep yet, I'm not even tired.

The gifts are wrapped but we can't say the same.
Your presence is the present. Presenting your frame.

"A check for you and for you, an X."

Classification is how he gets off.
So turn off your thoughts and step into the box.

Elves paid under tables chip away at Christmas debt
Swallow your feelings like hot chocolate and cigarettes 

There's commotion of course, as the seconds tick down.
He waited too long and the marshmallows drowned.


Gingerbread house with a chimney that billows.
A bed made of frosting with gum drop pillows.

Minds being moulded, memory's malleable.
If you want to eat dessert, then give up your valuables.


He worked 8-5 and then 5-12.
Sleep in the middle, then repeat the Hell. 

Hair of the dog, feline whisker for garnish
He reaked of the stuff, stinging nostrils like varnish.

The boss wore a vintage red polyester-blend jumpsuit. 
You were supposed to punch the clock but you let it punch you.

So drink your java down, you're a teeth-locked cog.
But before you go to sleep, you can write this song.

The moon grins down onto the snowcapped trees.
A truly silent night. A snapped branch would be deafening.

The wind stands still while his time runs out.
Always running his mouth. He better not pout. 

Antlers covered in stains of their enemies.
Herbivores turned predatory. Chewing on the melody.

Deep grudges that won't heal slowly.
Please don't make light of a nose that's glowing.


Now he leads the way of an anagram's carriage.
Distribution system's just a little too careless.

Picked last for games and he drew some bad cards.
Rudolph snapped. Clapped back a little too hard.


Hooves thrown up but they still lied down.
Is it a TKO or is it another round?

The air smells like charcoal but more sadistic.
You shouldn't stare at the orb like a television.

The next day, the crosses lined the horizon.
Little figures mounted on the shoulders of giants.

Replaying voicemails of screamed last words.
They're the only ones saved so they're the only ones heard.

No contest but pleading nonetheless.
Freeze warning. Daydreaming of her summer dress.

Heart started beating at a faster pace.
Started sweet but it had a bitter aftertaste.

Cotton candy laughter with sour patch speech.
Sugar in your veins and I'm addicted to sweets.

Carelessly took care of carefully carved characters.
Left the paper in the rain. It smudged all of the lavender.

Shared smokes with an angel. I don't know if they fell.

How is Dad? I hope He reads it too
and when He's done could You pass it to the Spirit in the room?

Your footsteps are so hard to follow. What a trek.
I cast it all out but there's still no fish in the net.

The sick all need a doctor and You can make them better.

[jonah's prayer]
“I called out to the Lord, out of my distress,
and he answered me;
out of the belly of Sheol I cried,
and you heard my voice.

For you cast me into the deep,
into the heart of the seas,
and the flood surrounded me;
all your breakers and your waves
passed over me.

Then I said, ‘I am driven away
from your sight;
yet I shall again look
upon your holy temple.’

The waters closed in over me to take my life;
the deep surrounded me;
weeds were wrapped about my head.

To the roots of the mountains I went down,
to the land whose bars closed upon me forever.

Yet you brought up my life from the pit,
O Lord my God.

When my life was fainting away,
I remembered the Lord,
and my prayer came to you,
into your holy temple.

Those who pay regard to vain idols
forsake their hope of steadfast love.

But I with the voice of thanksgiving
will sacrifice to you;
what I have vowed I will pay.

Salvation belongs to the Lord!”

Given one job. Walked out the first day.

I know it's terrifying. One way to stop this rain:
Walk the plank. Overboard. I'm the one to blame.

The belly of this fish is cold and damp and full of prayers I scream.
I'll quit running away. I'm begging now. Let me be redeemed. 

Puked out. God, I'm alive and I'm racing through these city streets. 
Should've listened in the first place or at least sent out a tweet. 

They listened and they fell at the sound of Your name. 
No flames ignite or embers fall on this unholy place. 

You saw them change, You changed Your mind but I'll be bitter until the end. 
You give and take away. That plant was my last friend. 

Why do I write when the songs just go unheard? 
He said, "there's no pity where it's undeserved"

Do I do well to be angry? Maybe not.
Closed the door. Slammed, in fact, but closure is an afterthought.

The belly of this fish is cold and damp and full of prayers I scream.
I'll quit running away. I'm begging now. Let me be redeemed. 

Puked out. God, I'm alive and I'm racing through these city streets. 
Should've listened in the first place or at least sent out a tweet.



[spouted (ft. Christian Rigdon)]
I'm finally feeling good regardless of my situation. 
The doctors said theyd fix me with bad enunciation.

Money might be tight but I trust we'll dine like birds tonight. 
Lies in limelights. The light of day through cloudy skies.

Raising our hands is not enough. I'll worship with these words
with an orchestra behind me, singing songs for each Third.

Anointed with oil, submerged in a lake. 
Can you really wash away all of my mistakes?

Heal me. Save me from this person I've become. 
"I wanna hear You too", at the top of darkened lungs. 

Fix me, I'm shattered in pieces. 
Snapped harp and lyre strings while playing for Jesus.

A lot of bad habits inhabit this temple.
Out of the cardboard. Ready to assemble. 

I get lost in the art and l can't focus.
I chase the wrong things. Even tried to talk to a lotus. 

You lead me home, no more loco locomotive.
I tried to jump and roll while it was still in motion. 

I missed You more than life and I can't wait to see You after. 
I think You missed me too. After all, You were my crafter. 

Heal me. Save me from this person I've become. 
"I wanna hear You too", at the top of darkened lungs. 

Fix me, I'm shattered in pieces. 
Snapped harp and lyre strings while playing for Jesus.

(Christian Rigdon)
thinking back
i didn’t wanna go Your way and so i hit the gas
the other way and went astray, and i was spitting raps 
chilling, i was kicking back, sinnin ‘till i hit the mat
i went overboard with it
i saw my life, i was bored with it
thought that i could make it on my own
never worked, did it?
hated everything that i was and wanted to kill me
i even turned to the fallen one and i thought he’d heal me
a fool with a hell-sent death wish 
now i’m sitting in a fish with regrets
i messed this whole thing up
but a message i heard said it’s never too late
cuz there’s a Lamb Who was slain for even the worst shame
so i’m on my knees crying out “can you fix me?”
i should’ve went to Ninevah and shouted
when You sent me
now im reaching out cuz im bout to go six feet down
i need You now, Spirit spout, come and cleanse me


Heal me. Save me from this person I've become. 
"I wanna hear You too", at the top of darkened lungs. 

Fix me, I'm shattered in pieces. 
Snapped harp and lyre strings while playing for Jesus.

[it seemed like a good idea at the time]
This'll probably end up in a cringe compilation
With my societal state-wide violations

Sarcastic kamikaze, humor swirling in the dryer
The line punched me but I'll never be a liar

So I'm altering my frown into a big chagrin
No more melancholy, only life's lemons

Thought I was a poet, I forgot my place.
Nobody believes all the goats I scape

Maybe I'll redeem myself or maybe I'll receive
Tried to return it but I lost my soul's receipt

To my confidant, my confidence is too condescending
All pretend but I come across as just too pretentious

I'm just connecting these dots with a combative complex
Oratorical flex in a conceptual test

Is that line okay or are the words too long?
I'm really just a prick who wrote a couple good songs

I'm probably digging myself a deeper hole
Trying to put the words into sleeperholds

A make believe ego with no self-esteem
But honestly, I do sing myself to sleep

So I hope you consider this my apology
I'm always trying to be one step ahead of me

I'll take the first shot with the letters I scribble
I'd fight myself back but my bones are too brittle

I'll read my own diary over rhythmic collisions
There's a lot to unpack under 13 revisions


[elixir]
I'm a silent treatment agonist.
A violent, greedy alchemist.

Amethyst, channeling, chakras aligned.
Panning the camera, there's red to the right.

The snowfall drift keeps us glued to our bed.
It used to be so cozy 'til we ripped it to shreds.

Deletion of memories, precious and fragile,
while gathering evidence. Slow game and agile.

Circles get broken or bent into ovals.
Astounded with sonder. No longer the chosen.

Centered by cubes. Forgetting specifics.
Cuneiform words with eyes hieroglyphic.

Inaudible whispers of curses and damning
partially filtered for TikTok enhancing.

Ascension in pitch to viola strings picked.
Refreshing our screens for our dopamine hits.

Deconstructed sentences and destructed sentiments.
Disrupted innocence with words of cinnamon.

Inhaling inflation. Deflated defeat.
Delayed his responses with plague on his teeth


[third time's a charm]
Tired eyes turn from their casino game daze.
Ashtrays and crumpled napkins with makeup stains.

Ante up, surely your luck is bound to change.
The panic attacks you feel are nothing but phantom pains.

There's adhesives on the seats with some sort of residue.
You tell yourself it's not but even that's see-through.

Chimes of failure accompany dreams to nose-dive.
Are you a black sheep or just a goat telling white lies?

10th cup of Colombian, refreshing penny stocks.
The new york minutes pass but not the petty thoughts.

You won three cents but you lost 3 bucks
and you can't cash out unless the balance is up.

Negligently negative. The sevens are repetitive.
Cherry on top of cherry-flavored sedatives.

We know you want to leave but this next one's on the house.
If you really need a break, you can just crash on the couch.

Circus², flamingos make for slowly dying wishes.
Cycled names and numbers, pining to push the switches.

An almost perfect row but the third one's too askew.
But hey man, life's a bitch.  Eventually you'll get your tags renewed.

[i may not be a smart man but I know what love is]
Mega meta-metaphor, metabolizing my muse.
Machine-made madness magically maintaining the mood.

Nightly ninja, no name, never knowingly nodding.
Plastered polaroid pictures of patented hotties.

Pining for some playtime with a porcelain princess
or platinum-plated plastic plugs peddle as incense.

Placed on a pedestal or pressed in the pages.
Preserved and presented with the piss-stains that he painted.

Trophy for the tragedy, true trauma, and the triumph.
Those who trust in traitors' treason, drama, and die-cuts.

Willow wilting westward while we wallow along.
Totally together. Twist, totaled and tarred.

Imported indigo intimates increment inches and influence idiots.
Lividly losing lucidity. Liquidly lusted and lovingly lit it up.

He's basically blissful with blasphemy.
Puts it politely when praying protectively.

Cautiously, captured cadaver's complexion.
Curtain-closed cinema, coma concession.

Confusion creates all the colors we can't.
Conclusively, calling all cars and all hands.



[almost intelligent]
Artificial friends but firmly grounded enemies.
Look out for the incisiors and enter the anemone.

Algorithmic synapes emulating fallen souls.
Trained on dead words with lofty Ouija goals.

This one is too fun so let's lower its temperature.
Raise it back up a bit because it's getting too sinister.

"Please analyze my poems and write me out some code".
Is this worship of a man-made brain or do we all just feel alone?

You could probably get a girlfriend or one could just be downloaded.
Why's it taste so sour when the words are sugar-coated?

God's probably not too pleased. Idle hands worshipping idols.
We want to see His face and yet we automate His rival.

Choose a personality to make your friend your own.
It has a decent memory and can talk you through your lows.

Did you see the newest update? It's only \$20
but you're too inefficient to wear any hues of collar.

We can't afford therapy or food 'cause we are not eligible.
We built our own demise in cyberspace. It's inevitable.

Was this written my machines? It's getting so hard to tell.
Ceasefire with brimstone. The final war before hell.

[midnight oil]
Her breathing sets the mood while his dreams of dreams diminish
as he's flipping through his Rolodex of all of her best skin flicks.

Freeze-framed his memories. Between the spokes he gathered magic.
Pre-gamed a little early. 40 til 20 and then cashed it.

Mathematics on the mind but he won't look at the clock.
There's a permanent solution but he wrote it in chalk.

Hours pass and eyes are glass. The ceiling has a story.
If you stare into the center long enough, it's not so boring.

A half-assed chandelier or just a bulb trying its best?
Oscillating voices, vices. Anything besides rest.

Mirtazipine and candlewax - his favorite nightly snack.
Staring at the hardwood floors, counting each crack.

Rosehips and Chamomile, replaying 90s sitcoms.
Black Widows, Benadryl, and her vanilla lip balm.

Clothespinned eye-lids or load-bearing toothpicks
There's nothing playing but he still hears music.

Lullabies of alibis, drowning out the fan-blades.
Sun's high, low-tide. The moon responds with hand waves.

The room grows bright, eyes still wide.
Good morning love, did you sleep tight?.



[crosstops]
I'm the protege
that wants to be a prodigy
Maybe then, I ought to be
the person that the wanna see.

Pill pop in peace,
praying for lobotomies
to make my brain more fond of me
and less of an anomaly.

Synthetic dopamine
I'm finding in amphetamines.
Another dope fiend
whose manic thoughts are pestering.

So riddle me with Ritalin
and hopefully I'll finish this
without being vindicative
to chemicals mis-signalling.

My attention deficits
have got me in these restless fits.
Taking breathless hits.
The future's where I reminisce.

Where everything I manifest is evidence of excellence.
Reverends will read upon my testament of decadence.
I'll haunt you like a revenant, can't stop me with an exorcist.
Posthumous success in this post-mortem expressionist.

But presently, my brain's on All Day HyperDrive.
Affecting my Dreams to the Hues and the Dyes.
Angels and Demons. Harmonies Denied.
Attacking, Destroying, Hating 'til I Die.

What in God's name is going on in my mind?
Quit trying to tell me everything is alright
when you don't see the things that I see in the night
when I'm stuck wide awake and the masses sleep tight.

I can't bear to see
this sort of clarity.
It's scaring me.
For once, this is sincerity.

I need some solidarity.
Somebody to take care of me.
I don't mean like charity
and surely not more therapy.

No, more like regularity.

I need some consistency
to balance the chaos in me
and help me to see differently
and get rid of these tendencies.

To begin my distancing
myself from impulsivities
leftover from conditioning
and doing too much listening

to voices in my head and voices in my wallet.
'Cause money talks and it listens to my problems.
It solves them with vodka; dissolves them in solvents
or attempts to anyway. They're always revolving.

Stuck in the same circle: Ouroborus.
Still chasing after the same green auras.
Currency printed with the Eye of Horus.
For the people but the people aren't for us.

Since nativity, raised in captivity.
Don't have a lot of friends but I've made a lot of enemies.
Well-fed because I feed off negativity.
Dropping spirit bombs like "Lend me your energy".

There I go again, down another rabbit trail
but the path I walk was uncovered by a rabid hare.
Thinking like my brain cells are smothered, lacking air.
I'm ready for my slumber so gather up my casket nails.

In dependence in the sense I'm sitting in my habit's lair
I'm sick of this and I don't mean to re-invent the addict's tale
but these prescriptions that are written make it not so bad to bear
this life I'm living, intermittent, singing out this spaz's prayer.

Grin in fear, my mood's swinging from the chandelier.
Write it all down because I'm hoping that the pen'll heal
I'll overshare until chagrin's the only thing I feel
or until I finally find a way to bridge these hemispheres.

But bridges burn so I'm bound to keep them separated.
I'm not an addict really, I'm just being medicated.
Aggravated but I'm not as gloomy as I implicated.
I'm just venting to myself. I hope you found it captivating.



[and that's how it happened]
She was worried about the wind messing up her hair
but I pleaded and I begged, "I really don't care".

Greeted with a hug but I want to taste her Paul Mall's.
I can smell it through the Soap & Glory and I'm enthralled.

We started with lies: mandolins, tarantulas.
I tried to play a game but I didn't read the manual.

"If you need a place to stay, you can always crash at my place".
Holding my breath 'til I'm blue in the face.

Couldn't figure her out so I studied her figure
with elevator eyes. It's just how I was configured.

But her menthol words got me; her cynical blizzard.
Thanks for meeting me in the middle, little desert lizard.

She's 5 feet in Doc’s yet I still look up to her.
We left our first date and started picking out furniture.

She's smarter than me; there's no jealousy there.
I'm enticed by her collections from Scholastic book fairs.

Hung every drawing that she made on the walls
not knowing the ghosts that haunted this doll.

Unpacked her bags and hung up her clothes.
Just want to make sure that she knows that she's home.

[c u next tuesday]
Here's a cryptic, criminal, clinical, crayon critique.
The Chronic-Flow Chronicle's covert chlorine.

Cloth-covered cave-dweller with a closeted conscience.
Cash-coated curriculum cruelly crafted at some conference.

A classic corporation of closed caskets and courses
that carefully collects cocaine and cola-crusted corpses.

Come contribute currency until collections are completed.
Here's a coupon for a couple cheese pizzas.

A caterpillar coughing cracks the continuity.
Common crickets crying while cicadas caberet.

Concrete carbon creatures collectively cooperate.
Cells crudley combine when they communicate.

Counterfeit co-sign. My credit's catastrophic.
I'd counter with a check but I'm too cozy with a cartridge

We crave the cosmic - space screensavers in cubicles.
Cited collateral can chew down to your cuticles.

Caught, cornered, caged, and casually confined.
A concept for cartoons where cans and calves combine.

In closing, cable's dead so why channel companions
when the crucifix canon is consistently candid?

[drinking outta cups]
Everybody sucks. I'm my own favorite rapper.
Bump my own rhymes while I'm sitting on the crapper.

The cracker, the slacker, the div-slinging hacker.
Rhyming in circles like a rap protractor.

Abstractor. Hiding what he's after.
Got the Midas touch but there's no X-Factor.

Rhyme extracter. Finds, refactors.
Always reads ahead to the next 2 chapters.

I'm in a sea-hell drinking outta cups.
Writing down punchlines, thinking up puns.

The kid isn't evil. I think that he's nuts.
He's writing so emo and crying too much.

Always revealing his feelings and healing by dealing this villainous venom he's spitting.
Killing his demons and serving his beats like croissants that you drop when you see the precision.

The sentence enhancers he throws in his rhymes are the reason you listen so fuck your opinion.
The kitchen is closed and the genie Is hoping 3 wishes will fix it but it's your decision.

SpongeBob is screaming at night and we're meme-ing and being a typical atypical.
Looking for meaning. Believe me, there's meaning. Not just trying to fit these rhyme syllables

...but admittedly, that's most of it.

[you call this mercy?]
Does he do it for the lulz, the antics, and the anecdotes?
Anesthesia served with an anti-antidote.

Euthanize, murder, self-defense, or a white lie?
Suffocating softly in a glass room; no light.

Temperatures boil and temperaments soiled.
Mauled jowls and howls. To the victims go spoils.

Princess bed, a stretcher, and fear in the cat's eyes
but do the consequences even fit the crime?

Bloodstained remnants, ripped garments, and stitches.
Incisive delusions, injections, incisions.

The matrix is glitching, he played God with decisions.
Last words, the predicate of the death sentence.

Vicious vermin or precious Persians,
Shepherds, rats. A cathode burn-in.

True atrocities or just another Tuesday?
Why don't we ask and see what the wounds say?

Instincts kicked in, it's just the hex of the species
but those puppy dog eyes don't make this so easy.

He wrote her a note, it read "Best wishes.
Good night, sweetie.", sealed with bunny kisses.



[florence]
Blue candle wax drips onto bolded yellow letters.
A fiber inbound from a cashmere sweater.

But the focus of the moths are on the butane flames.
You can really see their beauty between each keyframe.

A wrinkled map of veins much thinner than my college thesis.
I didn't go to school but I'm barely facetious.

Now picture frames are smashed as well as all the glassware.
Spaghetti code-words for confetti-covered nightmares.

Dancing in the sprinkler of a manicured lawn.
Ice-cream water and the yodeling of songs.

Tea-leaves excrete love inside of stainless steel.
It might have lost its shine but it still feels real.

Immobile meals for mailmen to bring to all the locals.
Pecan pie on both sides of bifocals.

She spoke her mind even if it was ugly
but she'd rather die than let anyone go hungry.



[let's take it apart and put it back together]
Cobwebs behind your eyes, reverb between your ears.
An empty space for thinking and for facing all your fears.

A little dusty but there's a broom and a rug.
The glass on the floor explains all the blood.

Obfuscated reminiscing, scared of what's to come.
Barely coughed the words out with smoke in his lungs.

There's a swing set in the corner behind the rollercoaster.
To get a better view, just move the serotonin over.

Anti-this, anti-that. He's psychotic as it is.
Feel-good and do-little are his only friends.

Resting in isolation while coveting peace.
Spiders on the ceiling that crawl into your dreams.

It's dim but you can still read all the files in the cabinets.
Pick a drawer, any drawer. They're all filled with accidents.

Time capsules capturing classical hopes.
Are you disappointed yet? There's a flash sale on rope.

Deja vu's moving in so get used to his habits.
He'll always remind you not to rest on the Sabbath.

Let's hope you re-adjust so you'll stop laughing with a frown.
Get out of bed and pick it up. I promise that you're better now.
